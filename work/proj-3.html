<strong>The scenery was</strong> captured with Backbone's Camera paired with RaptorVision's 270 degree lens.
We did some test shooting in full HD but quickly realised we needed to bump up the resolution to
achieve some sense of realism with our application. Therefore, we
filmed in 4K, 30 FPS for all our clips. This turns out to be several gigabytes of
mp4 files, but after compression we managed to get the entire program down to about
800 MB, with no visual loss in quality. The video clips are mapped to Unity's video
material and placed on the skybox. Whenever the player does an interaction to change
the location we change the video clip of
the material to the index of a list of video clips corresponding to the right action.
