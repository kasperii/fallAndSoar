<strong>Instead of giving</strong> all the story elements a specific order, we
wrote the story parts so that they could be found in any order.
This was also what made the game more fun.
Trying to puzzle together all the seemingly random clues presented itself a
fun challenge. Instead of forcing all the story elements onto the player,
we allowed them to miss them. This enforced the feeling of
exploration. However, this had us making more content just to fill all the rooms.

<strong>We did design</strong> some “bottlenecks”. Parts which the player couldn’t
pass if they hadn't it triggered certain parts. This was
because we didn’t want to overwhelm the player with everything right away.
This, and of course that it would make the complexity of recording it all
much lower. Before recording we had to not only write the script and
build a event graph, but had to also figure out exactly what to record in
each location. When we moved our camera we wanted all footage from that location
to be recorded. All pre-work was necessary, and with out our graph we would have been lost.
