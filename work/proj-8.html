<strong>
Letting people try</strong> out our game during our open house demo gave us new ideas
of how to take this further. Some aspect of our gameplay were
well perceived and worked really good for the format
- while some aspect had to be worked on.
The essence of our demo user study showed the following:
</p><p>
<strong>The look and</strong> hold interaction as we called it worked really good, the timing
with 1.5 second timer was well tuned to not feel too long. The video format wall well received - 
and the cellar environment helped build the suspension for the game. This was also built with
the use of audio. Without the narration and music people would not have enjoyed the game
</p><p>
<strong>On the negative</strong> side of user feedback, we did have some cases of cyber sickness.
This was probably due to our wrapping of the video - video is a hard format to work with. We did also
notice that people got lost easily. This is also a limitation with the format. VR is
a challange to get right.</p>  
<p>
<strong>The future of</strong> this project would have been to build a framework of this.
So that it would have been easy to produce a mute mike III. This form of storytelling takes
some tries. But we have high hopes on video explorative VR games.</p>
