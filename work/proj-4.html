<strong>The sounds in</strong> the game are designed to give the player another reliable feedback method,
making them rely less on visual feedback to guide them.
With the use of auditory feedback we diminish awkward solutions of interaction
with the environment. Insead of having an specific
video of e.g. a hand reaching out to pick up a key or opening a door,
a universal “key-picked-up”- or “open-door” sound can be played.
With this approach to feedback interaction we dodge breaking the
experience, creating cyber sickness, or requiring more video
files and special cases for us to handle.

<strong>We wrote and</strong> recorded all voice overs in the OL (osqledaren) studio on
campus, while the sound effects were found on free source websites.
We later edited and mixed all the sounds to fit the tone of
the VR environment. The sound effects was given a slightly echoing
‘roomy’ feel, making them fit the atmosphere in the video recordings.
As for the voice overs for the main character, they’re
designed to sound like thoughts in the players head. 
All sounds were constantly user tested and adjusted accordingly.
