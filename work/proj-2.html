The conceptual game is a project developed during the second half of the course AGI at KTH, Royal Intitute of Technology.

In the game you play as Mute Mike, an ex-rapper, now infiltrator at the Stockholm PD. You have just
infiltrated the mob when something goes wrong - someone has been murdered. Your task is to explore
and find out who is the killer, while at the same time trying to escape the mansion.
