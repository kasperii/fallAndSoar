<strong>First thing I</strong> did was figuring out a solution to get from position A to position B.
I had two types of interactions in mind.
Either you could click on a physical button on the phone while looking at a
position or use fuse buttons [1]. Using physical buttons would break the immersion we
thought so I continued on the second idea. Instead
 of using fuse buttons in the scene I modified the concept and
 called it a fuse pointer because it was the pointer/crosshair
 which had the fuse on it and not the buttons themselves. An early
 prototype was developed where you could click on three buttons
 to test this idea.
</p><p>
<strong>The feedback from</strong> the users were positive about
 the interaction except that the fuse
 timer was too slow. This was then adjusted from 2 seconds to 1 second. I
 tested myself the 1 second fuse timer and thought it was too fast as
 I “clicked” unintentionally many times. Lastly it was adjusted
 to 1,5 second which appeared, after user tests, to be a
 good balance between “clicking” unintentionally and not having
 to wait for too long until “click”. According to the users it
 was enough time to find out what in the scene was
 interactable while not “clicking” by mistake.
</p><p>
<strong>The interaction with</strong> objects in the scene was the same as
 navigating from position to position. The
 only difference was that instead of changing
 position when “clicked” a monologue was played
 or a a key was taken or something else. Something
 activating by “clicking” on their corresponding click zone.
</p><p>
<strong>By looking around</strong> in a scene you explore and find
 out what is interactable. Either a position
 or a point-of-interest (which we called the “objects” of interaction). This means of
interaction proved to be succesfull and was neihter too hard nor too easy.
